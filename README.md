# pebblegame

In order to simulate a pebble game, all the **.java** files must be compiled into their respective **.class** files. In addition to this, you must have either a **.txt** file or a **.csv** file with a list of numbers that act as possible values for pebbles. These files **must** be in the same folder as the **.class** file for the pebble game. Once this is done, the **PebbleGame** class file should be ran and the game will begin.

---

In order to run the tests, the **PebbleGameTest.java** file should be compiled into its respective class file, which should be in the same folder as the **testRanges.txt** file.

The framework we have used for testing is **JUnit 4**, so this dependancy will need to be installed on your machine if you intend to run the tests.
